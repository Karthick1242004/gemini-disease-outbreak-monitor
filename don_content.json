        "content": "The Timor-Leste government reported to the World Health Organization on 22 March 2024, its first confirmed fatal human case of rabies. The country is currently classified as rabies-free.\r\nThe case, from Pasabe Sub-Region, Oecusse, with a history of dog bite on 26 December 2023, went to a local health center on 20 March and died on 22 March 2024. \r\nDuring 2024, as of 24 April, a total of 95 exposures to dogs have been reported in Oecusse Municipality. Ten dogs were confirmed positive for rabies using rapid diagnostic tests. Out of the 95 exposures, seven had been bitten by confirmed rabid dogs.\r\n\r\nThe public health response is ongoing and includes vaccination of dogs, risk communication, training of healthcare workers on case management, active surveillance, and ensuring the availability of rabies vaccines and human rabies immunoglobulin.\r\nBased on the currently available information, the WHO assesses the risk posed by this event as high at the national level and low at regional and global levels.\n\nOn 22 March 2024, the Timor-Leste Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry, reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) its first confirmed fatal human case of rabies. The case is a 19-year-old female from Pasabe Sub-Region, Oecusse, formally known as the Special Administrative Region of Oe-C\u00fasse Ambeno (RAEOA - Portuguese acronym). The case was confirmed by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCT) at the National Health Laboratory in Timor-Leste on 22 March from a saliva sample taken prior to the individual\u2019s death.\nOn 20 March, the patient presented to a local health center with symptoms including high fever, vomiting, sore throat, cough, difficulty swallowing food, hydrophobia, photophobia, back pain, and neck stiffness. It was reported that she was bitten on the hands by a dog on 26 December 2023 in Oecusse. During the investigation, residents described the dog as very aggressive, and reported that it had not bitten anyone else. The dog died and was buried on 27 December 2023. The patient had not received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after the dog bite. On 21 March, she was transferred to Guido Valadares National Hospital (HNGV) in the capital city of Dili and died on 22 March 2024.\nAs of 24 April 2024, a total of 95 exposures to dogs have been reported in Oecusse Municipality. The Tetanus Toxoid (TT) and Rabies PEP vaccines were administered to all. Rapid diagnostic tests have confirmed that ten dogs were infected with rabies. Out of the 95 individuals who were exposed to dogs, seven were bitten by dogs that were confirmed to have rabies. Among these cases, two individuals have completed their post-exposure prophylaxis vaccinations (as of 24 April 2024).\nIt should be noted that Oecusse is an enclave of Timor-Leste located within Indonesia East Nusa Tenggara province (NTT) where between 1 January and 15 March 2024, six human rabies deaths have been recorded. In 2023, a total of 30 human rabies deaths were reported from NTT province.\n\nRabies is a vaccine-preventable, zoonotic, viral disease affecting the central nervous system. Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is nearly 100% fatal. In up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are responsible for rabies virus transmission to humans. Yet rabies can affect both domestic and wild animals. It spreads to people and animals via saliva, usually through bites, scratches or direct contact with mucosa (e.g. eyes, mouth or open wounds). Children between the ages of 5 and 14 years are frequent victims. Direct human-to-human transmission has never been documented, however it has occurred from infected organ/tissue donors to transplant recipients.\nThe incubation period for rabies is typically 2\u20133 months but may vary from 1 week to 1 year, depending on factors such as the location of virus entry and the viral load. Initial symptoms of rabies include generic signs like fever, pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking, or burning sensations at the wound site. As the virus moves to the central nervous system, progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops. Clinical rabies in people can be managed but very rarely cured, and not without severe neurological deficits. Rabies deaths occur mainly in those who cannot immediately access effective post-exposure prophylaxis. According to the Union Against Rabies Forum (launched by FAO, WHO and WOAH), globally, every nine minutes one person dies from rabies. Almost half of them are children.\nPeople can be protected against rabies through a vaccine given to individuals as pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis is the emergency response to a rabies exposure. This prevents the virus from entering the central nervous system, which would invariably result in death.\n\nThe Timor-Leste Ministry of Health has taken the following public health response actions:\nDog vaccination has been conducted in the Municipalities of Covalima, Bobonaro, RAEOA, and Dili achieving a coverage rate of more than 70% as of 24 April 2024. Dog vaccination is ongoing with a target to achieve 100% coverage.\nRisk communication to raise community awareness via social media, community campaign and press conference, advising citizens residing in the border area to vaccinate their dogs, avoid contact with wild animals, observe if there are any changes in dog behavior, report dog bite incidents for immediate treatment and rabies vaccination.\nProviding training to healthcare workers in all health care facilities on investigation and clinical management of suspected rabies exposures.\nImplementing active surveillance, with all dog bite cases now required to be reported to the Community Health Centers (CHCs) with necessary information recorded and provided with appropriate case management. Staff have been trained for surveillance and outbreak investigations.\nEnsuring availability of rabies vaccines and human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) in all CHCs and regional referral hospitals.\nCommunity health centers in bordering areas have been provided the human rabies vaccine, and trainings have been conducted on rabies vaccination for health workforce of CHCs.\nWHO supported a joint risk assessment and training for human health and veterinary services professionals on rabies prevention and control.\nOrganising Rabies Tripartite Expert Mission to Timor-Leste with Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), WHO and World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH).\nWHO procured 1000 doses of human rabies vaccines and distributed them to hospitals and health clinics. Funds were further mobilized for fast tracking emergency procurement of additional 5000 rabies vaccine doses and 1000 vials of rabies immunoglobulin by WHO.\nCollaboration between the Timor-Leste Ministry of Health and WHO is ongoing to provide additional anti-rabies vaccines and RIG to individuals who have been exposed to a suspected rabid animal.\n\nThe risk at the national level is assessed as \u2018High\u2019 due to the following:\nThe country was previously classified as \u201crabies free\u201d and has now reported      the first confirmed human case. As such, experience and awareness of      community and health care workers on rabies are likely limited.\nOecusse, the municipality where the current case was bitten and reported from, is      an enclave of Timor-Leste located within East Nusa Tenggara province (NTT)      in Indonesia where rabies is endemic in both dogs and humans, and where      between 1 January and 15 March 2024, six human rabies deaths have been      recorded.\nInsufficient stock of human rabies vaccines in the government health facilities.\nThe health workers in the areas considered at high risk of rabies have been      trained for dog-bite management. A recent survey shows that 91% of health      workforce in Oecusse have demonstrated knowledge of dog-bite management      including PEP and RIG administration. However, in other parts of      Timor-Leste health workers have limited knowledge dog bite and scratch      case management including PEP and RIG administration. The      rabies case management guidelines have yet to be finalized and training      needs to be conducted on clinical management.\nTimor-Leste has a significant population owning dogs and more than 70% vaccinated in      the areas bordering Indonesia.\nDog vaccination programme is continuing very effectively. Currently more than      35,000 dogs are vaccinated as of 24 April 2024. Despite limited human      resources, 102 dog vaccinators are doing door-do-door campaign in the      border areas and Dili to provide dog vaccine.\nThe frontliners from human health and those considered at higher risk have not      received pre-exposure vaccine due to non-availability of the same.\nSince Timor-Leste's only land border is with NTT province in Indonesia, which is already endemic for rabies (humans and canines), the risk of the international spread of rabies from Timor-Leste to other countries is unlikely. Available data indicates only the current one fatal case of rabies in Timor-Leste, with no links to international travel, tourism or international gatherings.\n\nAlthough highly effective animal vaccines have been available for over a century, rabies remains present on all continents except Antarctica. Rabies is included in\nWHO\u2019s 2021\u20132030 Roadmap for the Global Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases\n, which sets regional, progressive targets for the elimination of targeted diseases. Rabies elimination is feasible and achievable if this goal is prioritized and financially and politically supported. The key to implementing effective rabies elimination programs is to engage with local communities, start small, catalyze long-term investment through stimulus packages, ensure the ownership of governments, demonstrate success and cost-effectiveness, and scale up quickly.\nAs a zoonotic disease, rabies requires close cross-sectoral coordination at the national, regional and global levels, including:\nRisk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE):\nRaising awareness of rabies disease through engaging communities and empowering people to seek early treatment whenever they are exposed to a rabid animal. This includes an understanding of how to prevent rabies in animals, when to suspect rabies, and what to do in case of exposure.\nImmunization of persons:\nVery effective rabies vaccines and rabies immunoglobulins are available to immunize people after suspected exposure to rabies (post-exposure prophylaxis). Appropriate wound management and prompt access to quality-assured PEP are almost 100% effective in preventing human rabies deaths. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended for people in certain high-risk occupations (such as laboratory workers handling live rabies and rabies-related viruses) and people whose professional or personal activities might lead to direct contact with bats or other mammals that may be infected with rabies (such as animal disease control staff and wildlife rangers). PrEP might also be indicated for outdoor travellers and people living in remote, highly rabies-endemic areas with limited local access to rabies biologics.\nMass dog vaccination:\nAs dogs transmit up to 99% of human rabies cases, the control and elimination of rabies in dogs prevents rabies at its source. Vaccinating dogs, including puppies, is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people, and reduces the need for PEP. Mass dog vaccination with high quality and safe vaccines, aiming at 70% coverage in endemic areas interrupts Rabies virus (RABV) transmission at its animal source and saves human lives. Education on dog behaviour and bite prevention for both children and adults is an essential extension of rabies vaccination programs and can decrease both the incidence of human rabies and the financial burden of treating dog bites.\nWildlife vaccination:\nOral rabies vaccination for use in wildlife is available with efficacy claims for several wildlife species, such as foxes, raccoon dogs, wolves, coyotes and raccoons.\nThis event does not interfere with travel and trade. Travellers must be made aware of the risk of contracting rabies while traveling to areas considered at higher risk such as border areas with Indonesia.\n\nUpdate: This report dated 10 April has been updated on 9 May 2024.\nThe previous DON erroneously reported 29 suspected cases, it has now been revised to include data and correct information up to 24 April 2024.\nWHO Rabies fact sheet\nRabies Vaccine: WHO position paper- April 2018\nWHO.

        "content": "As of 30 April 2024, over 7.6 million dengue cases have been reported to WHO in 2024, including 3.4 million confirmed cases, over 16 000 severe cases, and over 3000 deaths. While a substantial increase in dengue cases has been reported globally in the last five years, this increase has been particularly pronounced in the Region of the Americas, where the number of cases has already exceeded seven million by the end of April 2024, surpassing the annual high of 4.6 million cases in 2023.  Currently, 90 countries have known active dengue transmission in 2024, not all of which have been captured in formal reporting. In addition, many endemic countries do not have strong detection and reporting mechanisms, so the true burden of dengue globally is underestimated. In order to control transmission more effectively, real-time robust dengue surveillance is needed to address concerns about potential undetected cases, co-circulation and misdiagnosis as other arboviruses, and unrecorded travel movements. These factors could contribute to unrecognized disease spread and establish a potential risk for local transmission in non-endemic countries. \r\n\r\nDengue virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes.

While a substantial increase in dengue cases has been reported globally in the last five years, this increase has been particularly pronounced in the Region of the Americas, where the number of cases has already exceeded seven million by the end of April 2024, surpassing the annual high of 4.6 million cases in 2023. Furthermore, this is three times what was reported during the same period in 2023, highlighting the acceleration of this health problem.\u00a0 Dengue virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Cases are most commonly asymptomatic or result in mild febrile illness. However, some cases will develop severe dengue, which may involve shock, severe bleeding or severe organ impairment.\nThe risk of dengue is similar across regions, countries, and within countries. Factors associated with\u00a0an increasing risk of dengue epidemics and spread to new countries include:\nearly start and longer duration of dengue transmission seasons in endemic areas;\nchanging distribution and increasing abundance of the vectors (\nAedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus)\n;\nconsequences of climate change and periodic weather phenomena (El Nino and La Nina events) leading to heavy precipitation, humidity, and rising temperatures favouring vector reproduction and virus transmission;\nchanges in the circulating serotypes within a country affecting population immunity;\nfragile health systems amid political and financial instability in countries facing complex humanitarian crises and large-scale population movements impairing the public health response;\nmovement of people who are infected and goods that could carry the mosquito vectors.\nCurrently, 90 countries have known active dengue transmission in 2024, not all of which have been captured in formal reporting. In addition, many endemic countries do not have strong detection and reporting mechanisms, so the true burden of dengue globally is underestimated. In order to control transmission more effectively, real-time robust dengue surveillance is needed to address concerns about potential undetected cases, co-circulation and misdiagnosis as other arboviruses, and unrecorded travel movements. These factors could contribute to unrecognized disease spread and establish a potential risk for local transmission in non-endemic countries.\nTo strengthen global surveillance, and monitor temporal trends and disease incidence, WHO has established a global dengue surveillance system with monthly reporting across all WHO regions, which is now available as a\ndashboard\n.\u00a0\u00a0 This has so far captured 103 countries (Figures 1 and 2) including 28 zero reporting countries. No autochthonous or locally transmitted dengue cases have been reported in Europe\u00a0so far in 2024 but these data will be added when autochthonous cases occur, which can occur when seasonal conditions permit vector activity from June to November.\nGiven the current scale of the dengue outbreaks, the potential risk of further international spread and the complexity of factors impacting transmission, the overall risk at the global level is still assessed as High\nand thus dengue remains a global threat to public health.\nFigure 1. Epidemic curve of dengue cases and deaths as reported to WHO from January to April 2024*\n*\nNote: includes 103 countries so far integrated in the WHO global surveillance system, 28 of which have submitted zero reports to date\nFigure 2: Geographical distribution of dengue cases as reported to WHO from January to April 2024*\n*Note: only 103\r\ncountries integrated in the WHO global dengue surveillance system so far are\r\nshown\nCo-circulation of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses\nThere is considerable overlap in the geographic distribution of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, which are all transmitted by\nAedes\nmosquitoes and share some clinical features that can result in misdiagnoses and misreporting in the absence of differential laboratory testing. Surveillance data during large outbreaks of \u2018suspected dengue\u2019 may erroneously include cases of one or both of the other diseases. For instance, in one study in Brazil (Ribas Freitas AR, et al., 2024), in the state of Minas Gerais in 2023, \u2018suspected dengue\u2019 accounted for 84.4% of cases of the 828 654 cases of \u2018suspected arboviruses\u2019, and \u2018suspected chikungunya\u2019 only accounted for 15.6%. The true proportion of the two diseases amongst laboratory-confirmed cases was 65.9% chikungunya and only 34.1% dengue.\nSurveillance systems specifically targeting endemic transmission of chikungunya or Zika are weak or non-existent in many countries. Misdiagnosis between diseases is a surveillance concern because skewed surveillance can misinform policy decisions. As dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses share the same\nAedes\nmosquito vectors and co-circulate in the same geographic areas, they also share many prevention strategies, such as differential diagnosis, mosquito control and public awareness campaigns. However, there are important differences between these diseases that affect risk populations, patient management and use of health care resources. For instance, Zika is particularly dangerous for pregnant women due to its association with Congenital Zika Syndrome. Consequently, expanding surveillance to simultaneously monitor for all three viruses can help public health authorities accurately determine the true burden of each disease, refine risk assessments, and optimize clinical management and resource allocation for more effective public health interventions.\nSo far in 2024, more than 250 000 cases of chikungunya have been reported to WHO and almost 7000 cases of Zika virus disease. Figure 3 shows countries/territories/areas with evidence of current or previous circulation of at least two of the three viruses.\nFigure 3:\nCountries, territories or areas with previous or current local mosquito-borne transmission of more than one\nAedes\n-borne virus (dengue, chikungunya and Zika) as of 30 April 2024\nRegional overview\nAfrican Region\nThe African region is strongly affected by arboviruses, although the exact burden is not well understood due to challenges with laboratory capacity. There is evidence of current or prior dengue circulation in local populations and/or among travellers returning from approximately 30 African countries. In 2023, outbreaks were reported in 15 countries in the WHO African Region: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe, Senegal, and Togo.\nIn 2024, from 1 January to 28 April, 13 countries are known to have ongoing active transmission of the dengue virus \u2014 Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Niger, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe, Senegal, and the Seychelles. A total of 32 925 dengue cases (14 095 confirmed; 1051 severe cases) and 57 deaths have been reported from these 13 countries and an additional 16 countries have reported zero cases through their respective routine surveillance mechanisms. Circulation of three of the four dengue serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3) has been identified in the WHO African region. The current priority countries based on dengue burden are Burkina Faso, Mauritius and Mali. Burkina Faso reported 72% of all cases and 89% of all deaths in the region from the beginning of 2023 to 28 April 2024, and remains the country with the largest dengue burden, reporting 17 098 cases (52%) and 38 deaths (67%) in 2024. Mauritius reported 7177 dengue cases and 15 deaths during the first 17 weeks of 2024, with only DENV-2 serotype being detected to date. In Mali between 1 January and 28 April 2024, a total of 3231 dengue cases and three deaths have been reported, with two serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-3) currently circulating. The main challenges in addressing dengue in the affected countries include funding constraints that hinder preparedness and response, shortages of rapid diagnostic tests, vector control specialists, lab technicians, and entomologists.\nRegion of the Americas\nDengue is the most widespread arbovirus and causes the highest number of arboviral disease cases in the Region of the Americas, with cyclical epidemics every 3 to 5 years. The\nAe. aegypt\ni, the first vector mosquito for dengue, is established in all countries in the Americas except Canada, which has also reported no prior autochthonous dengue cases. Previously, the highest burden of dengue was reported in 2023 with 4 600 086 suspected cases, including 2 048 048 laboratory-confirmed cases being recorded. However, in 2024 as of the end of April, there have already been 7 517 060 suspected dengue cases (3 528 635 laboratory-confirmed), 7374 (0.10%) severe dengue, and 3504 deaths (Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) 0.05%) reported. There are three times more suspected cases in 2024 to date than over the same period in 2023. Several countries in the northern hemisphere are also reporting a significant number of suspected dengue cases even though they have not yet entered their period of high transmission, which typically occurs in the second half of the year.\nIn 2024, Brazil is the country with the highest number of cases, with 6 296 795 suspected dengue cases (3 040 736 laboratory-confirmed), followed by Argentina (420 867 suspected cases), Paraguay (257 667 suspected cases), and Peru (199 659 suspected cases). \u00a0All four dengue serotypes have been detected across the region and in 2024; six countries (Brazil, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Panama) have already reported the simultaneous circulation of all dengue serotypes.\nEastern Mediterranean Region\nDengue outbreaks continue to be reported in both fragile, conflict-affected, and/or vulnerable countries in the region that have weakened healthcare systems as well as countries with stronger healthcare systems that have been affected by unusual rains due to climate change.\nAe. aegypti\nand some\nAe. Albopictus\nmosquitoes have been identified in most of the countries in the region.\u00a0In areas affected by armed conflict, the lack of detailed and timely information complicates a coordinated dengue response. Additionally, timely data sharing also remains a challenge for other countries in the region for reasons such as the potential impact in the tourism, economy and other sectors.\nEuropean Region\nDengue is not endemic in the WHO European Region and reported cases are mainly travel-related. However, there have been sporadic autochthonous dengue cases and few dengue outbreaks reported in the region since 2010 with evidence of dengue transmission from five countries: Croatia, France, Italy, Portugal (Madeira), and Spain. In 2023, autochthonous cases were reported in three countries: Italy (82), France (45) and Spain (3). No autochthonous dengue cases have been reported in Europe so far in 2024, though the summer has not yet started when mosquito vector activity commences. Testing capacity for dengue is limited in many Member States in the WHO European Region, especially outside the European Union, and most cases likely are first-time infections and therefore mild and do not present for care, the actual numbers of dengue cases may be underestimated.\nStrong public health systems, good clinical care including access to early diagnosis, case referral, and management of severe cases, relatively short vector season, and relatively unsuitable conditions for disease transmission all contribute to reduced severe health impact and further disease spread for both imported and autochthonous cases. The region is preparing for, likely limited, local transmission in the upcoming summer and early autumn months.\nThe competent vector,\nAedes albopictus,\nhas been establishing itself further north and west in the European region over the past ten years. Additionally,\nAedes aegypti\nhas already been established in Cyprus, and Madeira, Portugal. While cold winters in the majority of the region do not allow for year-round transmission, the climatic suitability for transmission of dengue infections in the European region may increase with changes in climate, including potential higher temperatures and milder winters, increase in the geographical range of the competent vectors, and temperature suitability for virus transmission.\u00a0 Changes in humidity and precipitation (followed by floods and stagnant water pools) may also create more favourable conditions for the vector population and therefore increased suitability for transmission of dengue virus.\nSouth- East Asia Region\nIn the South-East Asia Region, all Member States have the environmental conditions for dengue endemic transmission, and all have systematically reported dengue cases, except the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. There are clear seasonal patterns in dengue incidence, associated with the climate patterns in respective countries.\nIn 2024, Indonesia is experiencing a surge in dengue incidence, with 88 593 confirmed cases and 621 deaths as of\u00a0 \u00a0 30 April 2024 \u2013 approximately three times higher than the same period in 2023. In 2024 Bangladesh, Nepal, and Thailand have reported a higher number of cases compared to the same period of 2023. From January to April 2024, the CFR varied from 0% in Nepal to 1.09% in Bangladesh. However, interpreting these values requires caution since the case definition used varies across countries with some countries reporting only (lab confirmed) hospitalized cases (compared to others reporting probable cases from communities), hence leading to higher case fatality rate among those hospitalized or severe dengue cases.\nThe surge in dengue incidence is likely triggered by various factors, including shifts in the circulating serotype and climate change. At least five countries (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand) are currently grappling with the initiation of monsoon season, which creates suitable conditions for Aedes mosquito breeding and survival. Additionally, urbanization and population movements have played a pivotal role in the increasing burden in the region. Changes in the predominant circulating serotype increase not only the incidence but also the population risk of subsequent exposure to a heterologous DENV serotype, which in turn increases the risk of higher rates of severe dengue and deaths.\nWestern Pacific Region\nThe Western Pacific Region continues to face a high burden of mosquito-borne arboviral diseases, particularly dengue, which is endemic in twenty-three countries in the region. In 2024, seven countries including Australia, Cambodia, China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Singapore, and Viet Nam have reported dengue cases; Malaysia and Viet Nam are the most affected as of 22 April, reporting 50 650 cases and 39 deaths (CFR 0.07%) and 16 111 cases and one death (CFR 0.01%) respectively. Factors such as climate change, underdevelopment of infrastructure, cross-border population movements, and the resurgence of global travel following the COVID-19 pandemic, increase the risk of further international spread. The number of cases is expected to continue increasing once the rainy season begins in June.\nThere have not been any large outbreaks reported from Pacific Island countries/territories (PICs) in several years however in 2024, outbreaks have been reported in Fiji (3841 cases), Samoa (261 cases), Tokelau (130 cases as of 23 January 2024) and French Polynesia (43 cases). With ongoing travel between the PICs and the presence of competent\nAedes\nmosquitoes, there is a risk of outbreaks occurring because of introduction from areas with active transmission.\nMember States in the region with endemic transmission continue to report longer seasonal dengue epidemics with increasing magnitude and geographic spread. However, disease burden estimation is less reliable due to the underreporting of cases, particularly in the PICs, based on their current syndromic reporting of dengue as dengue-like illness (DLI). Further, the reported number of deaths due to severe dengue is heterogenous across countries. As such, country-level and sub-national CFRs may appear inconsistent.\nA subset of the region requires additional support for dengue to address operational gaps in clinical management, surveillance, laboratory support, risk communication and community engagement, and operational management. There is also a need to improve adherence to the existing WHO \u201cFramework for National Surveillance and Control Plans for\nAedes\nvectors\u201d for non-endemic countries in the Pacific Region, particularly establishing a comprehensive Early Warning System that integrates climate, disease, viral/serological, and entomological surveillance.\n\nDengue virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes typically in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The primary vectors that transmit the disease are\nAedes aegypti\nand, to a lesser extent,\nAedes albopictus\nmosquitoes, though in some regions such as Europe and North America, this latter vector is more widespread.\nDENV has four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the same serotype and only transient immunity to the other serotypes, after which secondary infections with a different serotype increase the risk for severe dengue. Dengue cases are most commonly asymptomatic or result in mild febrile illness. However, some cases will develop severe dengue, which may involve shock, severe bleeding or severe organ impairment. This stage often starts after the fever has gone away and it is preceded by warning signs such as intense abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bleeding gums, fluid accumulation, lethargy or restlessness, and liver enlargement.\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue, but the timely diagnosis of dengue cases, identification of warning signs for severe dengue, and appropriate clinical management are key elements of care to prevent the progression to severe dengue and deaths.\n\nThe overall capacity for countries to respond to multiple, concurrent outbreaks continues to be strained due to the global lack of resources, including shortages of good quality dengue diagnostic kits for early disease detection, lack of trained clinical and vector control staff and community awareness. Emergency response mechanisms have been established, and WHO supports high-risk countries across affected regions; however, the needs continue to outweigh the available resources. Coordination with partners, including UNICEF, has led to the development and implementation of common analyses and priority-setting tools. Nevertheless, it is imperative to sustain and enhance partner collaboration.\nCountries are encouraged to learn and adopt successful examples of effective case management, prevention, and control of dengue and other arboviruses through heightened research projects, which is also aimed at limiting the vectors reducing their ability to spread across the urban context.

Dengue infections are the most common vector-borne viral infections worldwide, particularly impacting tropical and subtropical countries.\u00a0 DENV has the potential to cause epidemics resulting in high morbidity and mortality. The virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected\nAedes\nmosquitoes, most commonly\nAedes aegypti\nand\nAedes albopictus\n. The proliferation and propagation of mosquitoes depend on climatic factors such as temperature, humidity and rainfall. The arbovirus can be carried by infected travellers (imported cases) and may establish new areas of local transmission in the presence of vectors and a susceptible population. As they are arboviruses, all populations living in areas with the presence of\nAedes aegypti\nare at risk, however, their impact largely affects the most vulnerable people, in which the arboviral disease programs do not have enough resources to respond to outbreaks.\nInfection with one of the dengue serotypes (1-4) does not provide cross-protective immunity to the others, so persons living in a dengue endemic area can have four dengue infections during their lifetimes. Changes in the predominant circulating serotype increase the population risk of subsequent exposure to a heterologous DENV serotype, which increases the risk of higher rates of severe dengue and deaths.\u00a0 Severe dengue is characterized by vascular leakage, hemorrhagic manifestations, thrombocytopenia, and hypotensive shock, which can lead to organ failure and death. Age, interval between infections, antibody characteristics, viral factors, and host-specific genetics are contributing factors.\nMonitoring of the global dengue situation to date has shown that several factors are associated with an increasing risk of dengue epidemics becoming more extensive and less predictable, and these include;\nChanging distribution of the\nAedes aegypti\nvector;\nUrbanization and human activities fostering conducive environments for vector-host interaction;\nClimate change-induced shifts in weather patterns;\nFragile healthcare systems amidst political and financial instabilities;\nChanges in the predominant circulating serotypes and co-circulation of multiple dengue serotypes;\nChallenges in clinical diagnosis particularly in areas with co-circulation of other arboviruses;\nInadequate laboratory and testing capacity; Prolonged ongoing concurrent outbreaks, including COVID-19;\nInsufficient preparedness for the scale of the epidemic, and low capacity for dengue patient clinical management;\nLack of specific treatment for dengue;\nLack of engagement and mobilization of local communities in vector control activities; Insufficient vector surveillance and control capacities;\nLack of coordination among stakeholders, chronic underfunding, and low donor interest;\nLack of involvement of government sectors responsible for addressing social determinants e.g. implementation of policies aimed at improving conditions related to the risk of transmission, such as urban planning, water and sanitation provision, solid waste management, housing improvement, etc.\nLack of engagement and mobilization of local communities in vector control activities.\nWHO assessed the global risk of dengue as high on 30 November 2023, and subsequently assigned a WHO internal emergency response grade of G3 at the global level on 1 December 2023. Given the current scale of the dengue outbreaks, the potential risk of further international spread and the complexity of factors impacting transmission, the overall risk at the global level is still assessed as high\nand thus dengue remains a global threat to public health.\n\nDengue is primarily an urban disease of the tropics and the viruses that cause it are maintained in a cycle that involves humans and\nAedes aegypti\nmosquitoes\n.\nThe same mosquitoes transmit chikungunya and Zika viruses. The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for dengue virus infection.\nAedes\nspecies mosquitoes can become infected with the virus after biting individuals infected with DENV and then transmit the virus to others in the vicinity. This cycle, therefore, makes the infective mosquito capable of spreading the dengue virus within households and in the neighbourhoods of cases, leading to clusters.\nEffective vector control interventions are key to the prevention and control of dengue. Vector control activities should target all areas where there is a risk of human-vector contact, such as residences, workplaces, schools, and hospitals. WHO promotes Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control\nAedes\nspecies. IVM should include removing potential breeding sites, reducing vector populations, and minimizing individual exposure. This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e., environmental management and source reduction), especially monitoring water storage practices, draining and cleaning household water storage containers weekly, larvicide in non-potable water using WHO-prequalified larvicides at correct dosages, distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for fever/dengue inpatients to contain spread of the virus from health facilities. Indoor space spraying for rapidly containing dengue-infected mosquitoes may be challenging to deliver in densely populated areas.\nPersonal protective measures during outdoor activities include topical repellents to exposed skin or the treatment of clothing and using long-sleeved shirts and pants. Additionally, indoor protection can include the use of household insecticide aerosol products, or mosquito coils during the day; window and door screens can reduce the chances of mosquitoes entering the house and insecticide-treated nets offer good protection to people against mosquito bites while sleeping during the day. Personal protective measures are recommended from dawn to dusk due to the diurnal\nAedes\naegypti. These measures and mosquito control should also cover workplaces and schools since the vectors are day-biting mosquitoes. Entomological surveillance should be undertaken to assess the breeding potential of\nAedes\nmosquitoes in containers to target vector control activities and monitor insecticide resistance to help select the most effective insecticide-based interventions.\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue infection. However, early detection and access to appropriate healthcare for case management reduces mortality, as can rapid detection of dengue cases with warning signs and timely referrals of severe cases to tertiary healthcare facilities. Case surveillance should continue to be enhanced in all affected countries and globally. Where feasible, resources should be allocated for the strengthening of case referral mechanisms and for the confirmation and serotyping of the dengue viruses.\nVaccination against dengue should be viewed as part of an integrated strategy to control the disease, including vector control, proper case management, community education, and community engagement. WHO recommends the use of TAK-003 (only available vaccine) in children aged 6\u201316 years in settings with high dengue transmission intensity.\nCountries are encouraged to learn and adopt successful examples of effective case management, prevention, and control of dengue and other arboviruses through heightened research projects, particularly given the recent\nWHO recommendations on clinical trials\n. Implementing clinical surveillance and case and death report forms for dengue could be particularly useful in understanding the disease better and also form a basis for developing clinical trials for new therapies or quality improvement initiatives.\nWHO should closely review local interventions and under the best evidence to accept and recommend them for public health programmes, facilitating early adaptation to reduce the growing health impact of dengue.\nMinistries of Health and partners should closely review local interventions to accept and recommend them for public health programmes for early adaptation to reduce the growing health impact of dengue.\nWHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied to countries based on the available information.\n\nWHO Fact sheet: Dengue and severe dengue;\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue\nWHO Fact sheet: Chikungunya;\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya\nWHO Fact sheet: Zika virus;\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/zika-virus\nGlobal Arbovirus Initiative;\nhttps://www.who.int/initiatives/global-arbovirus-initiative\nPublic Health Situation Analysis: El Ni\u00f1o (October-December 2023);\nhttps://www.who.int/publications/m/item/public-health-situation-analysis--el-ni-o-(october-december-2023)\nECDC, Increasing risk of mosquito-borne diseases in EU/EEA following spread of Aedes species\nhttps://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/increasing-risk-mosquito-borne-diseases-eueea-following-spread-aedes-species\nLaboratory testing for Zika virus and dengue virus infections;\nhttps://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/359857/WHO-ZIKV-DENV-LAB-2022.1-eng.pdf?sequence=1\nDengue and severe dengue cases and deaths for the subregions of the Americas;\nhttps://www3.paho.org/data/index.php/en/mnu-topics/indicadores-dengue-en/dengue-regional-en/261-dengue-reg-ano-en.html\nWPRO dengue situation reports\nhttps://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/surveillance/dengue\nPAHO dengue situation reports\nhttps://www3.paho.org/data/index.php/en/mnu-topics/indicadores-dengue-en/dengue-regional-en/261-dengue-reg-ano-en.html\nIncreasing risk of mosquito-borne diseases in EU/EEA following spread of Aedes species;\nhttps://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/increasing-risk-mosquito-borne-diseases-eueea-following-spread-aedes-species\nAutochthonous vectorial transmission of dengue virus in mainland EU/EEA, 2010-present\nhttps://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/all-topics-z/dengue/surveillance-and-disease-data/autochthonous-transmission-dengue-virus-eueea\nWHO.

        "content": "On 5 March 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified by the Chad International Health Regulation (IHR) national focal point (NFP) of an outbreak of hepatitis E in the eastern Ouaddai province of Chad. Ouaddai province has been heavily affected by an influx of refugees and returnees fleeing the Sudan conflict since April 2023, with a majority being women and children.\r\nFrom 2 January to 28 April 2024, a total of 2092 suspected hepatitis E cases, including seven deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR) 0.3%), were reported from two health districts of the Ouaddai province, namely, Adr\u00e9 and Hadjer-Hadid. Among the 2092 suspected cases, 103 (4.9%) were from the host community and 1989 (95%) were reported from seven refugee camps and transit sites. Both rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to confirm the diagnosis on collected samples. \r\nThe most affected age groups are 6 -17 years (1113 cases) and 18-59 years (500 cases), representing 53.2% and 23.9% of the suspected cases respectively. A total of 27 pregnant women (1.3%) have been reported among the suspected cases. \r\nHepatitis E is often occurring in humanitarian settings such as in areas affected by conflict and in displacement sites.   Limited access to safe drinking water and inadequate sanitation and hygiene increases the risk of hepatitis E virus outbreaks.  The Public Health Emergency Operations Centre has been activated by the national health authorities. WHO deployed a multidisciplinary team in Adr\u00e9 to support setting up the response and response activities are ongoing with partners support. \r\nPrevention is the most effective approach against hepatitis E. Provision of safe drinking water, good hygiene practices, quality standards for public water supplies and provision of safely managed sanitation services can significantly decrease the risk of spread.\r\nWHO assesses the risk to be high at the national level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level.\n\nOn 5 March 2024, WHO was notified by the Chad IHR NFP of an outbreak of hepatitis E in the eastern Ouaddai province of Chad. The initial\u00a0alert of two cases of Acute Jaundice Syndrome (AJS) was raised on 2 January 2024, by a mobile clinic team supported by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) - Switzerland operating at the temporary high school refugee site in the Adr\u00e9 health district of Ouaddai province.\nFrom 2 January to 15 February 2024, 113 AJS cases were notified from the Adr\u00e9 health district. Of the 113 cases, 28 (24.7%) were tested using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for hepatitis E by MSF - Switzerland, eleven (39.2%) of which were positive. On 19 February 2024, the Hadjer-Hadid health district, bordering the Adr\u00e9 district, also notified its first suspected case of hepatitis E in the Allasha refugee camp.\nBetween 1 and 19 March 2024, a total of 40 samples were tested by PCR at the Institute Pasteur of Dakar, S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, for hepatitis E, yellow fever, dengue, West Nile fever, Zika, chikungunya, Rift Valley fever and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever\n.\nOf the 40 samples, 36 (90%) were positive for hepatitis E. The median age among the confirmed cases is 36 years (range from 2 to 55 years). The male-to-female ratio among confirmed cases is 0.9 and three confirmed cases were in pregnant women.\nFrom 2 January to 28 April 2024, a total of 2092 suspected hepatitis E cases including seven deaths (CFR 0.3%) were reported from two health districts of the Ouaddai province, namely, Adr\u00e9 and Hadjer-Hadid. Among the 2092 suspected cases, 103 (4.9%) were from the host community and 1989 (95%) were reported from seven refugee camps and transit sites located in five health areas of the Adr\u00e9 health district (Aboutengu\u00e9site, Ambelia site, Hilouta camp, Lyc\u00e9e d'Adr\u00e9 site and Metch\u00e9 camp) and Hadjer-Hadid health district (Allasha camp and Arkoum camp).\u00a0 Most cases have been reported from the Adr\u00e9 health district in Lyc\u00e9e d'Adr\u00e9 site (966; 46.2%), Aboutengu\u00e9 camp (531 cases;25.4%) and Metch\u00e9 camp (347 cases; 16.6%). Males (1160 cases; 55.4%) are the most affected. A total of 27 pregnant women (1.3%) have been reported among the suspected cases. The most affected age groups are 6-17 years (1113 cases) and 18-59 years (500 cases), representing 53.2% and 23.9% of the suspected cases respectively.\nHepatitis E often occurs in humanitarian settings such as in areas affected by conflict and in displacement sites. \u00a0Since January 2024, suspected cases of hepatitis E have been reported from camps hosting Sudanese refugees and Chadian returnees in the Ouaddai province of eastern Chad. Limited access to safe drinking water and inadequate sanitation and hygiene increases the risk of hepatitis E virus outbreaks in humanitarian settings such as war zones and camps for refugees and internally displaced people. The last hepatitis E outbreaks reported in Chad affected the Southeastern province of Salamat in 2017, with more than 1800 cases and 23 deaths recorded, and the southwestern province of Tandjile in 2021 with over 380 cases and two deaths reported.\n\nHepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is common in countries of Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia with limited access to adequate safe drinking water, poor sanitation and personal hygiene, limited health services or in areas of humanitarian emergencies.\nHEV is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, mainly through contaminated water. The risk factors for hepatitis E are related to poor sanitation conditions, which allow the virus excreted in the feces of infected subjects to reach water intended for human consumption. The infection resolves spontaneously in 2-6 weeks with a 0.5-4% lethality. Fulminant hepatitis, a severe liver function impairment caused by HEV, is more common in pregnancy. Pregnant women, especially in their second and third trimesters, are at increased risk of acute liver failure, fetal loss, and mortality. The case-fatality rate can be as high as 10%-50% in women in their last trimester of pregnancy.\n\nThe Public Health Emergency Operations Centre in Chad has been activated and an Incident Manager has been nominated by the national health authorities.\nA response plan has been developed to guide response activities and help with resource mobilization.\nResponse activities are ongoing in the affected districts with partners support (WHO, MSF Spain, MSF Switzerland, UNICEF, WFP, UNHCR), including strengthened epidemiological surveillance, laboratory confirmation of cases, case management, infection prevention and control (IPC), water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), risk communication and community engagement (RCCE).\nWHO deployed a multidisciplinary team in Adr\u00e9 to support setting up the response (coordination of health partners, harmonization of line lists, sample collection and shipment to Institute Pasteur of Dakar, etc).\nCommunity health workers have been trained by WHO and MSF Switzerland to support case detection, active case search and community sensitization in refugee and returnee camps.\nBorehole construction, pit latrine construction and faecal sludge emptying are being conducted with the support of WASH partners including MSF Spain and UNICEF.\nSanitary inspections have been conducted of the water sources used by the affected populations.\n1\nThe need to conduct vaccination is being assessed by the Ministry of Public Health and Prevention.\n\nThe outbreak is occurring in the Ouaddai province which has been heavily affected by an influx of refugees and returnees fleeing armed conflict in neighbouring Sudan since April 2023. The majority of hepatitis E cases have been reported from the Adr\u00e9 health district hosting three refugee camps with an average of 50\u00a0000 refugees per camp and a temporary refugee site housing approximately 170\u00a0000 refugees (UNHCR estimate).\nThe risk at the national level is assessed as high due to the continuous population movements between different refugee camps and host communities; poor hygiene conditions, low access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation facilities including wastewater management as well as limited access to essential medical services in the affected camps; challenges in the management of cases among pregnant women. In addition, the limited financial capacity to effectively contain the outbreak also contributes to increasing the risk of spreading the disease in the Ouaddai province and across the rest of the country.\nAlthough no ongoing outbreak of hepatitis E has been reported officially in countries bordering Chad, the overall risk at the regional level is considered moderate because of the continued population movements between Chad and Sudan or the Central African Republic that raise fears of the spread of the epidemic in the sub-region. At the global level, the risk is considered low.\n\nHepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is common in countries with limited access to adequate and clean drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene (hand washing with soap, environmental and domestic hygiene), and adequate health services, or in areas affected by humanitarian emergencies.\nPrevention is the most effective approach against this disease. At the population level, the most important interventions to reduce the transmission of HEV and the number of hepatitis E cases are provision of safe drinking water, quality standards for public water supplies and provision of safely managed sanitation services.\n2\nAt the individual level, \u00a0risks can be reduced by maintaining hygienic practices such as washing hands with clean water and soap - especially before handling food, avoiding consumption of water and/or ice of unknown purity, and following WHO hygiene practices for food safety.\nTo prevent the spread of hepatitis E, WHO recommends improving access to safe drinking water through water treatment and adequate sanitation. The quality of drinking water should be regularly monitored in areas affected by the epidemic. Coverage of improved latrines and safe drinking water sources should be increased to prevent open defecation and to ensure proper hand hygiene. Health promotion and prevention activities, as well as ensuring early, appropriate, and equitable healthcare services to combat hepatitis E epidemics, can help improve public health outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings. Since the incubation period for hepatitis E ranges from 2-10 weeks, cases may continue to occur up to the tenth week (maximum incubation period) even after measures to ensure safe water, sanitation and hygiene promotion have been adopted.\nInterventions must target vulnerable populations by establishing or strengthening antenatal diagnosis for pregnant women with symptoms, improving the population's hygiene conditions, strengthening national capacities for diagnosis and clinical case management, and cross-border collaboration with neighbouring countries.\nAlthough there is no specific treatment for HEV infection, there are some important general principles for triage of persons with features of acute liver failure in need of hospital care and treatment of complications. These are addressed in WHO guidance (Waterborne outbreaks of hepatitis E: chapter on diagnosis and case management of hepatitis E in outbreak settings). There may be special situations such as outbreaks where the risk of hepatitis E or of its complications or mortality is particularly high.\nTo date, the only hepatitis vaccine available is the HEV 239 recombinant vaccine (Hecolin\u00ae), licensed in China and Pakistan. WHO does not make a recommendation on the introduction of the vaccine for routine use in national programmes in populations where epidemic and sporadic hepatitis E disease is common. However, WHO recommends that national authorities should consider using the vaccine to mitigate or prevent outbreaks of hepatitis E and mitigate consequences in high-risk groups, such as pregnant women.\nWHO advises against applying any travel or trade restrictions based on the current information available on this event.\n\nWeekly report on the humanitarian and health crisis in eastern Chad linked to the influx of refugees and returnees following the Sudanese conflict (Period from 08 to 14/04/2024), available at:\n(link is external)\nWaterborne outbreaks of hepatitis E: Recognition, Investigation and Control, WHO 2014.\nhttps://www.who.int/publications/i/item/waterborne-outbreaks-of-hepatitis-e-recognition-investigation-and-control\nWHO: Hepatitis E vaccine position paper, May 2015, available at:\nhttps://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WER9018-185-200\nHepatitis E vaccination: Questions and answers 1 September 2019, available at:\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/hepatitis\nTechnical considerations and case definitions to improve surveillance for viral hepatitis - policy brief.

        "content": "The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of three human cases, including one death, of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) between 10 and 17 April 2024, by the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). All three cases were males from Riyadh aged between 56 and 60 years with underlying health conditions and were not health care workers. The three cases are epidemiologically linked to exposures in a health-care facility in Riyadh, although investigations are ongoing to verify this and understand the route of transmission. Since the beginning of the year, a total of four cases and two deaths have been reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The notification of these cases does not change WHO\u2019s overall risk assessment, which remains moderate at both the global and regional levels.\n\nBetween 10 and 17 April 2024, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) reported three cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including one death, to WHO. \u00a0All three cases were reported in Riyadh and linked to the same health-care facility. Two of the cases were identified through contact tracing following identification of the index case.\u00a0 The second and third case are suspected to be secondary health care associated cases due to contact with the index case. The investigations are ongoing to verify this and understand the route of transmission.\nThe index case is a 56-year-old male school teacher, and a Saudi national residing in Riyadh. On 29 March, he developed a fever, cough, runny nose and body aches. He sought medical care at the emergency room (ER) of a hospital in Riyadh on 4 April, where case number three was also being treated. He was then admitted to a ward on 4 April, where he shared a room with case number two. On 6 April, he was transferred to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) isolation and intubated, was tested by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and was confirmed positive for MERS-CoV. The case had underlying health conditions, including hypertension and chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis . There was no clear history of exposure to typical MERS-CoV risk factors. Close contacts, including 20 health and care workers and seven household members, were followed up, which promptly identified the two secondary cases. Investigations, including determining the source of the infection, are still ongoing. The index case died on 7 April.\nThe second case is a retired 60-year-old male Saudi national, residing in Riyadh. He was admitted to the ICU at the same hospital in Riyadh on 8 March 2024. On 31 March, he was transferred to a ward, where he subsequently shared a room with the index case on 4 April. The case developed a fever on 6 April and tested positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR on 8 April. He has underlying health conditions including heart disease and being a smoker. With no history of exposure to camels, the case is suspected to be a secondary healthcare-associated case due to contact with the index case, with investigations ongoing. The follow-up of 13 health and care workers and one patient has been completed, with no additional cases identified to date.\nThe third case is a 60-year-old male, retired military personnel and Saudi national, residing in Riyadh. On 4 April, he went to the ER of the same hospital in Riyadh, where the index case was also admitted. He was then admitted to the ward (different to the one that the index case and case number two shared) on 5 April. He developed shortness of breath on 10 April and was transferred to the ICU on 15 April. He tested positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR on the same day. He has underlying health conditions including chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis, malignancy, and liver disease. \u00a0No history of exposure to camels was identified and, like the second case, he is suspected to be a secondary healthcare-associated case due to contact with the index case. A follow-up of 14 health care workers is ongoing, with no additional cases identified to date.\nAs of 21 April 2024, the second and third cases remained in the ICU and were intubated on 9 April and 18 April, respectively.\nAdditionally, since the\nlast Disease Outbreak News (DON)\npublished on 16 February 2024, one further case has been notified through IHR mechanisms with no epidemiological link to the three cases described above. \u00a0The case is a 32-year-old male with comorbidities from Taif, KSA who had had direct contact with camels, he had onset of symptoms on 21 January and died on 17 February 2024.\nSince the first report of MERS-CoV case in KSA in 2012 until 21 April 2024, a total of 2204 human cases and 860 deaths have been reported (Figure 1). Overall, a total of 2613 MERS-CoV cases and 941 deaths have been reported from 27 countries, in all six WHO regions. Of these 84% of the cases and 91% of the deaths have been reported from KSA, including these newly reported cases and death. \u00a0Since 2019, no MERS-CoV cases have been reported from countries outside the Middle East.\nThere was one large outbreak outside of the Middle East in the Republic of Korea, in May 2015. It was characterized as a health care-associated infection, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in the Republic of Korea and 1 in China) and 38 deaths were reported; however, the index case in that outbreak had a travel history to the Middle East. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR (2005) or directly by Ministries of Health to date. The total number of deaths is based on numbers reported to the WHO through follow-up with affected Member States.\nFigure 1:\nEpidemic curve of MERS-CoV cases (n=2204) and deaths (n=860) reported in KSA between 2012-21 April 2024*\n\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection caused by the MERS-CoV. Approximately 36% of patients with MERS have died, though this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems, and the case fatality ratio (CFR) is calculated based only on laboratory-confirmed cases.\nHumans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels, which are the natural host and zoonotic source of the virus. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in health care settings. Outside of health care settings there has been limited human-to-human transmission to date.\nMERS disease ranges from having no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms, to severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical presentation of MERS disease is fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, have also been reported. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older people, persons with weakened immune systems, and those with underlying health conditions such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes.\nThe number of MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO has substantially declined since the beginning of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, this was likely the result of epidemiological surveillance activities for COVID-19 being prioritized. The similar clinical picture of both diseases may result in reduced testing and detection of MERS-CoV cases. Since then, the Ministry of Health of KSA has been working to improve testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV by including MERS-CoV into sentinel surveillance testing algorithms from the second quarter of 2023, following negative test results for influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2 (responsible for COVID-19). In addition, measures taken to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g., mask-wearing, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving the ventilation of indoor spaces, respiratory etiquette, stay-at-home orders, reduced mobility) also likely reduced opportunities for onward human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV. Potential cross-protection conferred from infection with or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and any reduction in MERS-CoV infection or disease severity and vice versa has been hypothesized but requires further investigation.\nNo vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV-specific vaccines and therapeutics are in development. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient\u2019s clinical condition and symptoms.\n\nThe\r\nKSA Ministry of Health has initiated active contact tracing for the identified\r\ncases following their isolation, with daily monitoring throughout the 14-day\r\nincubation period and laboratory testing for high-risk contacts. Triage for\r\nrespiratory diseases has been implemented in the emergency department to enable\r\nearly detection of patients with respiratory symptoms, assisted by dedicated\r\nnurses available 24/7 for accurate documentation in the triage forms.\nIn\r\naddition, comprehensive refresher training on case definition has commenced for\r\nall health and care workers to ensure early detection of cases. Additionally,\r\ntraining sessions on the implementation of infection prevention and control\r\n(IPC) standards and transmission-based precautions related to MERS -CoV are\r\nongoing while ensuring the availability of IPC supplies such as hand sanitizers\r\nand personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nThe notification of these cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries. In addition, cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of raw camel milk), or in a health-care setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, into the testing algorithm were warranted and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\nHuman-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in health-care settings has been associated with delays in recognizing signs and symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, delayed isolation of suspected cases and delays in implementing IPC measures. IPC measures are, critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in health-care facilities. Health and care workers should apply\nstandard precautions\nconsistently with all patients at every interaction in health-care settings. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures or in settings where aerosol- generating procedures are conducted. Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures in health-care settings (including preventing overcrowding), and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.\nMERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus may be circulating. General hygiene measures should be followed, such as regular hand washing with soap and water or hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand rub, before and after touching animals. Contact with sick animals should be avoided.\nFood hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry regarding this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.\n\nMERS Fact sheet\nMERS global summary and assessment of risk\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome Overview\nWHO EPI-WIN Update 88: MERS-CoV, a circulating coronavirus with epidemic and pandemic potential - Pandemic preparedness, prevention and response with a One Health approach\nWHO EPI-WIN webinar: MERS-CoV, a circulating coronavirus with epidemic and pandemic potential - Pandemic preparedness, prevention and response with a One Health approach\nWHO-EMRO MERS monthly bulletin, March 2024\nDisease outbreak news\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome Outbreak Toolbox\nMERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea, 2015\nKorea Disease control and Prevention agency, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2015\nInfection Prevention and Control:\u00a0Standard precautions for the prevention and control of infections: aide-memoire\nTransmission-based precautions for the prevention and control of infections: aide-memoire, 2022\nWHO Infection Prevention and Control Infection prevention and control during health care for probable or confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection\nCitable reference:\nWorld Health Organization (8 May 2024).

        "content": "The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified about a case of human infection with an influenza A(H9N2) virus in Viet Nam on 9 April 2024 by the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP). The patient, who had underlying conditions and was in severe condition was admitted to the intensive care on 21 March 2024.  A respiratory sample was collected on 21 March and tested positive for influenza by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Subsequently, virus subtyping confirmed avian influenza A(H9N2) on 8 April. Case investigation identified that the case lives near a poultry market, where poultry trade occurs daily in front of his house. As of 15 April, there have been no reports of new cases with respiratory symptoms among contacts of the case or outbreaks in the community where the case resides. This is the first human infection with an avian influenza A(H9N2) virus reported in Viet Nam.  According to the IHR (2005), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus as low.\n\nOn 9 April 2024, the IHR NFP of Viet Nam notified WHO of one human infection with an avian influenza A(H9N2) virus.\nThe patient is a 37-year-old male from Tien Giang Province, Viet Nam, who had underlying conditions. The patient developed a fever on 10 March 2024 and was admitted to the hospital on 16 March. Following a diagnosis of severe pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) on 21 March and received treatment with oseltamivir and antibiotics. As of 15 April, the patient was still in severe condition and under intensive care.\nThe patient was detected through severe viral pneumonia surveillance (SVP). A nasopharyngeal swab was collected on 21 March, and the test result revealed positive avian influenza A with similar H9-strain gene segments on 22 March. On 1 April, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City (PI HCMC) performed PCR testing, which confirmed the presence of avian influenza A(H9) virus. Subsequently, virus subtyping confirmed avian influenza A(H9N2) on 8 April.\nCase investigation identified that the patient lives near a poultry market, where poultry trade occurs daily in front of his house. There have been no reports of dead or sick poultry near the patient\u2019s residence or of consumption of sick, dead, or uncooked poultry products from his household or neighbouring households. However, influenza A(H9N2) is not highly pathogenic in poultry. On 2 April, seven poultry samples were collected from two live bird trading points within the same commune. One sample was positive A(H5N1); the remaining were negative for avian influenza A(H5N1), A(H5N6), A(H5N8), A(H7N9), and A(H9). On 4 April, samples were taken from two geese at the patient's house, which tested negative for A(H5) and A(H9).\nFifteen close contacts of the case have been requested to self-monitor their health at home. As of 15 April, there have been no reports of new cases with respiratory symptoms among contacts of the case or outbreaks in the community where the case resides.\nThis is the first human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) reported in Viet Nam.\n\nInfluenza viruses natural reservoir is wild water birds, but some influenza viruses may infect poultry and mammals, including humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Avian influenza virus infections in humans may cause diseases ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to more severe diseases and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported.\nLaboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g. RT-PCR. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prognosis in some cases.\nTo date, globally there have been 99 cases of human avian influenza A(H9N2) infections, including two deaths, reported to WHO since 2015.\n\nThe government of Viet Nam has taken the following public health response actions:\nPI HCMC      and Ho Chi Minh City Center for Disease Control (HCDC), in cooperation      with the Tien Giang Provincial CDC, have conducted investigations, contact      tracing, and disinfection of the patient\u2019s residence and suspected      exposure areas.\nLocal public health and animal health sectors cooperated for further      investigation, contact tracing and testing for possible detection of potential      additional cases and/or outbreaks of avian influenza A(H9N2) or other      strains in humans and poultry.\nOn 5      April, the Ministry of Health issued a press release containing detailed      information about the case and provided public health messages on      proactive disease prevention and control measures.\n\nMost human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses are exposed to the virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. Further human cases can be expected since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations. No clusters of cases have been reported.\nCurrently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability to be sustained in transmission among humans. Thus, the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.\n\nThis case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and influenza surveillance. A thorough investigation of every human infection is essential.\nThe public should avoid contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms and live poultry or surfaces that might be contaminated by poultry droppings. Hand hygiene, with frequent washing or the use of alcohol hand sanitizer, is recommended. WHO does not recommend any specific different measures for travelers.\nAll human infections caused by a new subtype of influenza virus are notifiable under the IHR (2005). State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic.\nWHO advises against applying any travel or trade restrictions based on the current information available on this event.\n\nHQ Global influenza programme,      human-animal interface:\nhttps://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/avian-influenza\nWHO Monthly Risk Assessment      Summary:\u00a0 Influenza at the human-animal interface:\nhttps://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/avian-influenza/monthly-risk-assessment-summary\nWPRO Avian Influenza Weekly      Update:\nhttps://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/surveillance/avian-influenza\nProtocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory      diseases:\nhttps://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/WHO-WHE-IHM-GIP-2018.2\nMaintaining surveillance of influenza and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 adapting Global      Influenza surveillance and Response System (GISRS) and sentinel systems      during the COVID-19 pandemic:\nhttps://www.who.int/publications/i/item/maintaining-surveillance-of-influenza-and-monitoring-sars-cov-2-adapting-global-influenza-surveillance-and-response-system-(gisrs)-and-sentinel-systems-during-the-covid-19-pandemic\nCase definitions for the four diseases requiring notification in all      circumstances under the International Health Regulations (2005):\nhttps://www.who.int/publications/m/item/case-definitions-for-the-four-diseases-requiring-notification-to-who-in-all-circumstances-under-the-ihr-(2005)\nCase information of influenza A (H9) in Tien Giang Province.

        "content": "The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified about a laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with an influenza A(H5N1) virus on 1 April 2024 by the United States of America IHR National Focal Point (NFP).  The patient developed symptoms on 27 March and had a history of exposure to dairy cattle (cows) presumed to be infected with influenza A (H5N1) virus. This is the second confirmed human case of influenza A(H5N1) detected in the country. It also appears to be the first human infection with A(H5N1) acquired from contact with an infected mammal, although human infections with other influenza subtypes have previously been acquired from mammals.\r\n\r\nNo additional associated cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1) have been identified. Since the virus has not acquired mutations that facilitate transmission among humans and based on available information, WHO assesses the public health risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and for occupationally exposed persons, the risk of infection is considered low-to-moderate.\n\nOn 1 April 2024, the IHR NFP of the United States of America notified WHO of a laboratory-confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) detected in the state of Texas.\nThe case is aged over 18 years. On 27 March, the case developed conjunctivitis, was reported to be while working at a commercial dairy cattle farm and had a history of exposure to dairy cattle (cows) presumed to be infected with influenza A(H5N1) virus\n(1)\n.\nOn 28 March, respiratory and conjunctival specimens were collected from the case and tested at the Texas Tech University Bioterrorism Response Laboratory. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that both specimens were presumptive positive for influenza A(H5) virus. The specimens were then sent to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) for further testing. They were received and tested at the US CDC on 30 March and confirmed as high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus clade 2.3.4.4b by RT-PCR and sequencing\n(1) (2)\n.\u00a0Genome sequencing of the virus didn\u2019t show new mutations possibly associated with increased transmission to humans.\nOn 28 March, the patient was advised to isolate and given antiviral treatment (oseltamivir) following US CDC guidance. The patient did not report symptoms other than conjunctivitis, was not hospitalized, and at the time of reporting, was recovering (\n1)\n.\nHousehold contacts\u00a0of the patient have not reported illness and have been provided influenza antiviral prophylaxis as per US CDC recommendations.\u00a0 No additional cases of human infection with\u00a0influenza A(H5N1) associated with this case have been identified\n(1)\n.\nIn the United States, since January 2022, detections of HPAI A(H5N1) virus among wild birds have been reported in 50 states or territories. There have been reports of sporadic A-(H5) virus outbreaks among poultry and backyard flocks as well as sporadic detections in mammals and outdoor cats on the dairy facilities as reported by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).\nInfluenza A virus infection is exceptionally rare in bovine species\n(3).\nThis human case had exposure to dairy cattle in Texas, presumed to be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) virus\n(4)(5)\n. On 25 March, the USDA reported the first detection of HPAI A(H5N1) virus in dairy cattle and unpasteurized milk samples from cattle in Texas and Kansas in four dairy herds. On 29 March, USDA announced confirmation of additional detections in dairy cattle in Michigan dairy cattle that recently received cows from Texas. USDA has also announced additional confirmed detections in dairy cattle in Idaho, New Mexico, and Ohio. To date, USDA has announced confirmed detections on 15 farms across six states: Idaho (n=1), Kansas (n=3), Michigan (n=1), New Mexico (n=2), Ohio (n=1), and Texas (n=7) (\n5,6\n,7). USDA is continuing to monitor and test samples collected from other farms where cattle are displaying decreased lactation, low appetite, and other signs\n(1,5,6,7)\n.\nThe USDA has\npublicly posted\nthe genetic sequences of several recently detected HPAI A(H5N1) viruses found in US wild birds, poultry, wild mammals and cattle in Texas\n(8)\n. The viruses are from clade 2.3.4.4b, which is the most common HPAI A(H5N1) virus circulating among birds worldwide currently.\u00a0 CDC has\npublicly posted\nthe genome of the virus identified from the patient in Texas and identified only minor changes when compared to the animal viruses\n(2\n).\u00a0 Between 9 February 2022 to 29 March 2024, more than 8000 people were actively monitored in the United States following exposure to animals presumed to be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses.\n\nAnimal influenza A viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.\nAvian influenza virus infections in humans may cause diseases ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to more severe diseases and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported in previous human infections with A (H5N1) viruses. There have also been a few detections of A(H5N1) virus in asymptomatic persons who had exposure to infected birds.\nLaboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g. RT-PCR. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prospects of survival in some cases.\nAvian influenza A(H5N1) virus belonging to Gs/GD lineage, clade 2.3.4.4b Eurasian-origin infections have been reported in birds in the United States since 2022. In late March 2024, HPAI A(H5N1) was also detected in dairy herds in Texas and Kansas\n(4,5)\n.\nThis is the first human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in 2024 in the United States and the second confirmed detection in human in the country. This also appears to be the first human infection with A(H5N1) acquired from contact with an infected mammal although human infections with other influenza subtypes have been acquired from mammals. The first detection of influenza A(H5N1) in human in the United States was identified in April 2022, in a person involved in culling birds at a commercial poultry facility in Colorado\n(9)\n.\nIn the past, small clusters of A(H5) virus infections were reported, including some involving health care workers, where limited human-to-human transmission could not be excluded; however, sustained human-to-human transmission has not been detected. In this event, the case had direct contact with cows presumed to be infected with A(H5N1) viruses and no further human cases have been detected associated with this event.\n\nLocal and national health authorities implemented the following public health measures\n(1,10)\n:\nPublic health officials are conducting surveillance activities in Texas in response to this detection.\nUS CDC is working with state health departments to monitor workers who may have been in contact with infected or potentially infected birds/animals and test those people who develop symptoms.\nUS CDC has issued recommendations for the public regarding avoiding unprotected contact with sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domestic fowl, and other wild or domestic animals, as well as animal droppings, litter, or materials contaminated by birds or other animals with suspected or confirmed HPAI A (H5N1) virus infection.\nUS CDC has issues recommendations to avoid consumption of raw or undercooked food or related uncooked food products, such as unpasteurized (raw) milk or raw cheese, from animals with suspected or confirmed infection with HPAI A(H5N1) virus.\nThe United States has a robust surveillance system that is designed to mitigate the spread of animal diseases, thereby protecting public health, and maintaining a safe food supply for domestic and international markets. The U.S. surveillance system includes a national network of border protection personnel at ports of entry\n(1).\n\nThis human case was reportedly exposed to dairy cattle in Texas, where HPAI A (H5N1) has recently been confirmed in dairy herds.\nFrom 2003 to 1 April 2024, a total of 889 cases and 463 deaths (CFR 52%) caused by influenza A(H5N1) virus have been reported worldwide from 23 countries. The most recently reported case in humans prior to the current case, was in March 2024 in Viet Nam\n(11)\n.\u00a0The human case in Texas is the fourth reported in the region of the Americas, the most recent prior case having been reported in Chile in March 2023\n(12).\nWhenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in birds, there is a risk for sporadic infections in mammals and humans due to exposure to infected animals (including livestock), or contaminated environments and thus, further human cases are not unexpected.\u00a0 Influenza A infection has been rarely reported in bovine species and spread among dairy cattle herds in four U.S. States is being assessed. Previously, there have been human infections with other avian influenza subtypes following exposure to infected mammals.\nSince the virus has not acquired mutations that facilitate transmission among humans and based on available information, WHO assesses the public health risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and for occupationally exposed persons the risk of infection is considered low-to-moderate.\nThere are no specific vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent H5 infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (from human cases and animal) and comprehensive investigations around human cases are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.\nIf needed, the risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.\n\nThis case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza.\u00a0Establishing and monitoring the extent of influenza A(H5N1) virus in dairy herds in the affected localities of the country should inform changes in the ongoing risk assessment.\nDue to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.\nWhen there has been human exposure to a known outbreak of an influenza A virus in or when there has been an identified human case of infection with such a virus, enhanced surveillance in potentially exposed human populations becomes necessary. Enhanced surveillance should consider the health care seeking behaviour of the population, and could include a range of active and passive health care and/or community-based approaches, including: enhanced surveillance in local influenza-like illness (ILI)/severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) systems, active screening in hospitals and of groups that may be at higher occupational risk of exposure, and inclusion of other sources such as traditional healers, private practitioners and private diagnostic laboratories.\nIn the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus with pandemic potential, including avian influenza virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.\nTravelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival.

        "content": "The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified about a case of human infection with an influenza A(H5N1) virus on 25 March 2024 by the national authorities of Viet Nam.\r\n\r\nThe patient, who had no underlying medical conditions, developed symptoms on 11 March and died on 23 March. Exposure to birds was ascertained to have taken place in the third week of February. Samples collected from close contacts tested negative for influenza A(H5N1) virus.\r\n\r\nThis is the first human infection with an avian influenza A (H5N1) virus reported in Viet Nam since 2022.\r\n\r\nAccording to the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO.\r\n\r\nBased on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus as low.\n\nOn 25 March 2024, Viet Nam National Focal Point (NFP) for International Health Regulations (IHR) notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of one case of human infection with an influenza A(H5N1) virus in a 21-year-old male with no underlying conditions from Khanh Hoa Province, Viet Nam.\nThe case developed a fever and cough on 11 March 2024 and was admitted on 15 March to a local hospital due to persistent symptoms, including abdominal pain and diarrhoea. On 17 March, his condition worsened, and he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a provincial hospital. On 20 March, the patient was transferred to another provincial hospital with a diagnosis of severe pneumonia, severe sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The case died on 23 March.\nOn 19 March, samples were taken for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing by the Pasteur Institut in Nha Trang, which resulted in a positive result for the influenza (H5) virus. On 22 March, genomic sequencing conducted by the Pasteur Institut of Nha Trang revealed the presence of the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus.\nInitial results from the case investigation revealed that during the second and third weeks of February 2024, the case went bird hunting. Between that time and the onset of illness, no contact with dead or sick poultry nor contact with anyone exhibiting similar symptoms was reported. Among close contacts traced, no further cases of influenza A(H5N1) were detected.\n\nAnimal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.\nAvian influenza virus infections in humans may cause diseases ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to more severe diseases and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported. There have also been several detections of A(H5N1) virus in asymptomatic persons who had exposure to infected birds in the days before a sample was collected.\nLaboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g. RT-PCR. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prospects of survival in some cases.\nFrom 2003 to 25 March 2024, a total of 888 worldwide human cases of infection of influenza A(H5N1), including 463 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 23 countries. Almost all cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) have been linked to close contact with infected live or dead birds, or contaminated environments.\nSince 2003, 129 human infections with influenza A (H5N1), including 65 deaths, have been reported in Viet Nam. The most recent avian influenza A (H5) case was reported in October 2022 from Northern Province of Phu Tho, Viet Nam.\n\nThe Government of Viet Nam has taken the following public health response actions:\nConducting epidemiolocal investigation, and disinfection of the patient\u2019s residence      and suspected exposure areas.\nContact tracing, isolation, testing and monitoring for close contacts of the      patient.\nTesting of samples from chickens and ornamental birds near the patient\u2019s residence.      All samples collected from these birds have tested negative for influenza      A(H5) viruses.\nIssuing an      official letter requesting the Provincial Department of Health of Khanh      Hoa province to prepare drugs (Oseltamivir), and other supplies, to timely      support the local hospitals and authorities in patient management and      containment of potential outbreaks.\n\nThis is the first human infection with an avian influenza A (H5N1) virus reported in Viet Nam in 2024, and since 2022.\nMost human cases of infection with avian influenza viruses reported to date have been due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments.\nHuman infection can cause severe disease and has a high mortality rate. These A(H5N1) influenza viruses, belonging to different genetic groups, do not easily infect humans, and human-to-human transmission thus far appears unusual. As the virus continues to circulate in poultry, particularly in rural areas of Viet Nam, the potential for further sporadic human cases remains.\nCurrently, available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5) viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans; thus, the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low.\nBased on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus as low. The risk assessment will be reviewed if additional virological and epidemiological information becomes available.\n\nThis event does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and influenza surveillance.\nThe public should avoid contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms and live poultry, or surfaces that might be contaminated by poultry dropping. Additionally, it is recommended to maintain good hand hygiene with frequent washing or the use of alcohol- based hand sanitizer.\nThe general public and at-risk individuals should immediately report instances of sick or unexpected animal deaths to veterinary authorities. Consumption of sick or unexpectedly dead poultry should be avoided.\nAny person who has had exposure to potentially infected birds or contaminated environments and feels unwell should seek health care promptly and inform their healthcare provider of their possible exposure.\nClose analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent influenza A(H5N1) viruses in both human and poultry populations, and serological investigations are critical to assessing associated risks to public health and promptly adjusting risk management measures.\nThere are no specific vaccines for influenza A(H5N1) in humans. However, candidate vaccines have been developed for pandemic preparedness in some countries. The WHO continues to update the list of zoonotic influenza candidate vaccine viruses (CVV), which are selected twice a year at the WHO consultation on influenza virus vaccine composition.\nWHO advises against implementing travel or trade restrictions based on the current information available on this event. WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or other restrictions due to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.\nState Parties to the International Health Regulations (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by a new subtype of influenza virus.

        "content": "Since the beginning of 2023, and as of 25 February 2024, a total of 13 countries in the WHO African Region have documented probable and confirmed cases of yellow fever (YF), namely Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Guinea, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, Togo and Uganda. Preliminary data for 2023 indicate a case fatality rate (CFR) of 11%. \r\nWhile the overall risk at the regional level was re-assessed as moderate and the global risk remains low, active surveillance is required due to the potential for onward transmission through travel and the presence of the competent vector in neighboring regions. The urban proliferation of Aedes spp. mosquitoes, which bite during the day, can also significantly amplify transmission risks, particularly in densely populated areas, leading to swift outbreaks.\r\nThe WHO-led global Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) secretariat coordinated preventive and reactive efforts and notably during 2023, substantially enhanced vaccination coverage. Approximately 62 million people have been vaccinated in Africa through preventive and reactive mass vaccination campaigns. Additionally, under catch-up campaigns in Sudan, approximately 4 million individuals received vaccination against YF.\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, and as of 25 February 2024, a total of 13 countries\u00a0in the WHO African Region have documented probable and confirmed cases of yellow fever (YF), namely Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Guinea, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, Togo and Uganda.\nPreliminary data for 2023 indicate a case fatality rate (CFR) of 11% and a sex ratio of 1.7 (M: F). The median age of cases is 25 years, with two-thirds (69%) of cases aged over 15 years. \u00a0Suboptimal surveillance capacity exists in many affected countries, with data fragmentation, limited integration with routine surveillance and clinical systems, and a lack of standardized case definitions that contribute to underreporting and increased mortality rates.\nDuring the last quarter of 2023 and as of 25 February 2024, a total of eight countries (Cameroon, Chad, Congo, DRC, Guinea, Niger, Nigeria, and South Sudan), have reported active YF transmission with confirmed YF cases\u00a0(Table 1). These countries have initiated response planning activities.\nChad, Gabon, Niger, Nigeria, and Togo** are currently awaiting the final classification of the YF laboratory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) positive samples.\nCameroon:\nThree YF cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, occurring in the weeks ending on 22 October and 13 November 2023. The country recorded probable and confirmed YF cases consistently throughout 2023, starting from the week ending 29 January 2023.\nChad:\nA yellow fever PCR-positive case with negative serology was reported on 18 January 2024 from a patient sampled on 10 October 2023, in the L\u00e9r\u00e9 district of the Mayo-Kebbi Ouest region.\nRepublic of the Congo:\nCases pending classification with the national health authorities. No further information was available as of February 2024.\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo:\nOne YF PCR-positive case with unknown vaccination status was reported on\u00a0 \u00a0 18 December 2023. Additionally, nine PRNT positive cases were recorded, eight of which have unknown vaccination status and one lacks information in the medical charts.\nGuinea:\nThree YF PCR-positive cases were confirmed at the Institute Pasteur Dakar (IPD). These cases were reported on 17 October and 23 December 2023 in a 6-year-old female from Faranah region, a 7-year-old male from the Koundara health district (sample collected on 6 December), and a 60-year-old female from the Gui\u00e9ck\u00e9dou district (sample collected on 15 December), representing three out of the seven country\u2019s regions. Notably, this occurrence is less than three years since cases were confirmed in the Koundara health district in 2020 and 2021.\nNiger:\nCase reported in the Tahoua city, Department of Tahoua during the first week of January 2024. No further information was available as of February 2024. Investigations are ongoing.\nNigeria:\nOne YF PRNT-positive case was reported in January 2024 in Lagos state in a 49-year-old male residing in a rural area. Investigations are ongoing.\nSouth Sudan:\nA confirmed YF case was reported on 24 December 2023, following the investigation of suspected cases and deaths of viral hemorrhagic fever. The case, a 24-year-old male, presented with fever, vomiting blood, and jaundice. Two additional cases were confirmed on 2 February 2024. As of 12 February 2024, South Sudan reported a total of 64 cases that fulfil the current outbreak case definition of YF, including 61 suspected cases and three confirmed cases from six out of 10 counties in Western Equatoria state: Yambio (33), Nzara (09), Tambura (12), Ibba (4), Ezo (5) and Maridi Counties (1). Among 61 suspected cases, there were six suspected deaths currently under investigation.\nFigure 1.

The child was vaccinated against YF, five years before and had no history of travel. Laboratory results showed a positive rapid diagnostic test for malaria, and she was treated accordingly. In addition, she presented a YF-PRNT result of 1/60. The child fully recovered from symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0 This case is pending case classification with the Ministry of Health.\n\nYellow fever is an epidemic-prone, vaccine-preventable disease caused by an arbovirus transmitted to humans primarily through the bites of an infected\nAedes spp.\nand\nHaemagogus spp.\nmosquitoes. The incubation period ranges from 3 to 6 days. Many people do not experience symptoms, but when they occur, the most common are fever, muscle pain with prominent back pain, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. In most cases, symptoms disappear after 3 to 4 days. A small percentage of cases progress to a toxic phase with systemic infection affecting the liver and kidneys. These individuals can have more severe symptoms of high-grade fever, abdominal pain with vomiting, jaundice and dark urine caused by acute liver and kidney failure. Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes, or stomach.\u00a0 Death can occur within 7 to 10 days in about half of cases with severe symptoms.\nYellow fever is prevented by an effective vaccine, which is safe and affordable. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to grant sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. The vaccine provides effective immunity within 10 days for 80-100% of people vaccinated, and within 30 days for more than 99% of people vaccinated.\n\nTo respond to yellow fever outbreaks, regional and national public health measures have been organized across several domains.\nCoordination -\nCountries have developed and rolled out national response plans aimed at tackling YF outbreaks with a focus on preventive measures, improved surveillance, and reactive vaccination campaigns. As per its strategy, the global Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) secretariat led the coordination of significant preventive and reactive efforts and, notably, during 2023, substantially enhanced vaccination coverage. Approximately 62 million people have been protected in Africa through PMVC and reactive mass vaccination campaigns (RMVC). Also, approximately\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 17.4 million children are protected through Routine Immunization in Africa. The WHO Regional Office for Africa, in conjunction with the EYE Strategy Secretariat, is supporting countries in their efforts to prevent and respond to YF outbreaks.\nSurveillance\n- Efforts have been bolstered in some countries including Cameroon, the Central African Republic and Guinea, to enhance their systems for the early detection and monitoring of\u00a0cases. This includes conducting root cause analyses to understand the factors driving outbreaks and performing immunity gap analyses to pinpoint vulnerable population groups for targeted vaccination efforts.\nCase Management and Vector control\n\u2013 Improvements have been made in capacity building for the clinical case management and measures for prevention and control have been enhanced nationally in the most affected countries. Vector control activities have also been planned in urban areas with confirmed YF cases to curb further spread.\nLaboratory testing -\nThere has been a significant strengthening of capabilities. National reference laboratories have enhanced YF IgM testing and PCR diagnosis capacities in some countries, complemented by regional reference laboratories for confirmatory testing. This strengthening extends to national and regional levels, facilitated by EYE strategy operations.\nVaccination \u2013\nVaccination\ncampaigns form a crucial pillar in the YF outbreak response.\nIn 2023, nearly 62 million individuals received vaccinations under the EYE strategy. This comprised 57.2 million reached through Preventive Mass Vaccination Campaigns (PMVCs) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, and Uganda, along with 686 405 individuals vaccinated through reactive campaigns in areas including the Central African Republic (Mbaiki), Guinea (Dabola district and Dinguiraye), and Niger (Gazaoua). Additionally, approximately\u00a0 \u00a04 million individuals received\u00a0\u00a0 vaccination against YF under catch-up campaigns in Sudan. All International Coordination Group (ICG) requests for vaccination have been met with funding and technical support, ensuring a timely vaccine supply to affected countries.\nRisk Communication and Community Engagement -\nThese\u00a0involve targeted communication strategies to enhance awareness about YF risks, preventive measures, and the importance of vaccination, especially targeting hard to reach populations such as nomads, refugees, forest workers, and internally displaced persons. Engagement with these communities is being prioritized to ensure a comprehensive understanding of YF risks and the benefits of vaccination.\nThis multi-faceted approach, which covers coordination, surveillance, case management, laboratory enhancement, vaccination, vector control and community engagement, underscores the essential components of the public health response to Yellow Fever outbreaks.\nDespite these robust measures, certain\u00a0vulnerabilities\u00a0remain. These include the challenge of competing outbreaks which may divert resources and delay response efforts, surveillance and laboratory challenges characterized by inadequate logistics, poor sample collection, and lengthy diagnostics turnaround times, and observed delays in reactive vaccination following yellow fever cases and submissions of ICG requests.\nAs of 4 March 2024, WHO is providing technical support to the national health authorities of Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Congo, DRC, South Sudan and Togo to assess the final classification of cases.\n\nAs part of the ongoing efforts to monitor and respond to infectious disease outbreaks,\u00a0on 12 February 2024, the World Health Organization conducted a Rapid Risk Assessment\u00a0for yellow fever. It aimed to reassess the current regional risk of multiple ongoing YF outbreaks, in the context of a resurgence of YF outbreaks in countries with a history of preventive vaccination campaigns and persisting immunity gaps, including capacities to support the response (e.g., technical capacities, vaccine supply and vaccination campaigns, laboratory and operations, support and logistics (OSL)) and to provide recommendations for a more effective and coordinated response.\nThe overall\u00a0risk at the regional level\nwas re-assessed as\u00a0moderate based\non several contributing factors observed in the region despite the efforts to control the spread of YF:\nStable number of\u00a0ongoing      outbreaks\u00a0across the region.\nPersistence of pockets of unimmunized      populations\u00a0although considerable efforts have been made in recent      years to protect the population through PMVC and reactive mass vaccination      campaigns (RMVC).\nDetection of YF confirmed cases in      urban areas,\nsuch as Douala city in Cameroon, which pose      significant risks due to high population density and international travel      connections, noting nevertheless the risk mitigation provided by a      relatively high average vaccination coverage\nRisk of cross-border spread,\u00a0particularly      from the outbreak in South Sudan, which shares borders with neighbouring      countries.\nLimited surveillance and laboratory      capacity\u00a0in certain regions may result in delayed detection,      underestimation of the extent of the disease and delayed response.\nPersisting\u00a0response challenges\nwith the case classification, investigation, and response operations,      exacerbated by competing health emergencies.\nCompeting outbreaks\nstrainthe capacity to respond effectively, with various simultaneous health crises,      including measles, poliomyelitis, mpox, cholera, diphtheria, hepatitis E,      Lassa fever, and dengue. These challenges are compounded by factors such      as food insecurity, security constraints, and complex humanitarian      contexts. Furthermore, public health and medical personnel are overburdened,      managing multiple parallel outbreaks alongside other health emergencies.\nSocio-economic factors,\u00a0high      levels of poverty and limited resource allocation contribute to the      challenge of controlling outbreaks effectively.\nWhile the global risk remains low, active surveillance is required due to the potential for onward transmission through viremic travellers and the presence of the competent vector in neighbouring regions.\nWhile progress has been made in controlling outbreaks, ongoing challenges and vulnerabilities underscore the need for sustained and coordinated efforts to protect public health. The impact on public health will persist until the ongoing outbreaks are controlled, vaccination coverage is high and immunity gaps in the population closed. The importation of cases to countries with suboptimal coverage and persisting population immunity gaps poses a high risk and may jeopardize the tremendous efforts invested to achieve elimination.\n\nYellow Fever is an epidemic-prone mosquito-borne vaccine- preventable disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes, notably\nAedes sp\n. and\nHaemagogus\nspecies. The urban proliferation of Aedes spp. mosquitoes (day feeders)) can significantly amplify transmission risks, particularly in densely populated areas, leading to swift outbreaks.\nSurveillance and Coordination:\nWHO emphasizes the importance of active surveillance, cross-border coordination, and information sharing. Investigating and testing suspected cases is crucial for outbreak control and prevention. Enhanced surveillance with investigation and laboratory testing of suspect cases is recommended.\nVaccination as a Primary Prevention Tool:\nVaccination is the primary means for prevention and control of YF. The WHO's EYE strategy prioritizes vaccination in countries reporting YF, integrating it into routine immunization schedules for individuals aged 9 months and above. Proof of vaccination is required for travellers to and from countries with YF risk, with specific exemptions. The WHO supports the expansion of vaccination coverage through routine programs and mass vaccination campaigns to enhance communal immunity.\nGuidance for International Travelers:\nAll international travellers aged 9 months and above heading to areas at risk of YF transmission, as determined by WHO, are advised to get vaccinated. The vaccine is deemed safe and effective, offering life-long protection. However, vaccination recommendations for infants under 9 months, and pregnant or breastfeeding women are nuanced, advocating for vaccination in high-risk scenarios after weighing the benefits against potential risks.\nRegulatory Aspects and Vaccine Validity:\nUnder the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), countries have the autonomy to require proof of YF vaccination from incoming travellers. The International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP) must document this vaccination, with validity extending throughout the vaccinated individual's lifetime. WHO-approved YF vaccines guarantee lifelong immunity, negating the need for booster doses for international travel.\nVector Control and Risk Communication:\nEffective vector control in urban settings and general mosquito bite avoidance strategies are recommended to prevent disease transmission. WHO urges Member States to inform travellers about YF risks, preventive measures, and to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms arise. This approach helps prevent the establishment of local transmission cycles through infected travellers.\nInternational Travel and Trade:\nWHO advises against imposing travel or trade restrictions related to YF. Continuous efforts to educate travellers on preventive measures, including vaccination, are encouraged.\nAdditional Recommendations:\nGiven the evolving nature of YF transmission, WHO advises Member States to remain updated with the latest information and guidelines available on the WHO International Travel and Health website. Local health authorities are encouraged to collaborate closely with WHO and other relevant stakeholders to implement effective YF prevention and control measures, ensuring the safety and well-being of populations at risk.\n\nWorld Health Organization (3 January 2023).

        "content": "In February 2024, Austria, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and The Netherlands reported an increase in psittacosis cases observed in 2023 and at the beginning of 2024, particularly marked since November-December 2023. Five deaths were also reported. Exposure to wild and/or domestic birds was reported in most of the cases.\r\n\r\nPsittacosis is a respiratory infection caused by Chlamydophila psittaci (C. psittaci), a bacteria that often infects birds. Human infections occur mainly through contact with secretions from infected birds and are mostly associated with those who work with pet birds, poultry workers, veterinarians, pet bird owners, and gardeners in areas where C. psittaci is epizootic in the native bird population.\r\n\r\nThe concerned countries have implemented epidemiological investigations to identify potential exposures and clusters of cases. Additionally, implemented measures include the analysis of samples from wild birds submitted for avian influenza testing to verify the prevalence of C. psittaci among wild birds.\r\n\r\nThe World Health Organization continues to monitor the situation and, based on the available information, assesses the risk posed by this event as low.\n\nAustria\nIn Austria, 14 confirmed cases of psittacosis were reported from five of the nine federal states in 2023, compared to the median of two cases (range: 1-4) per year in the previous eight years.\nIn 2024, there have been four cases of psittacosis reported as of 4 March 2024, with the earliest onset date of 24 January 2024. None of these unrelated cases notified in 2023 or 2024 have reported travel abroad and wild birds have not been mentioned as a source of infection.\nIn Austria, suspected and confirmed psittacosis cases, as well as deaths due to psittacosis are notifiable. The country did not report changes in diagnostic procedures (currently, serological tests are used) that could explain this increase in reported psittacosis cases.\nDenmark\nDenmark reported a marked increase in psittacosis cases from late 2023 to mid-January 2024.\nAs of 27 February 2024, 23 individuals tested positive for\nC. psittaci\nvia RT-PCR. Most of the cases were reported from the North Denmark Region, Zealand Region, and the Capital Region.\nSeventeen cases (74%) were hospitalized, of whom 15 had pneumonia and four died.\nFrom the epidemiological investigations, one case has been linked to domestic birds that tested positive for\nC. psittaci\n. Of the 15 other cases with exposure information available, 12 (80%) have indicated contact with wild birds (primarily via bird feeders). For three cases there is no information available on bird exposures, and for the remaining four cases, no direct bird contact has been reported. Transmission from chickens has been ruled out by testing of suspected birds in two of the cases with reported bird contact.\nOver the past five years, Denmark has reported between 15 to 30 human cases annually, most of which have been linked to exposure to domestic birds (e.g. parrots, parakeets, hobby birds such as racing pigeons) and ducks handled during hunting; however, each year several cases report no direct contact with birds, which suggests potential environmental exposure. There is no indication of increased testing or change in testing procedures in Denmark that could explain the current increase in psittacosis cases.\nThe National Health Institute of Denmark, Statens Serum Institute, suspects that infections are primarily associated with wild birds through the inhalation of airborne particles from the dried droppings of infected birds. The prevalence of\nC. psittaci\namong wild birds in Denmark is currently unknown, and plans are underway to examine samples from wild birds submitted for avian influenza testing to clarify this. It is assumed that the actual number of individuals infected with\nC. psittaci\nis much higher than reported. Some cases may be associated with exposure to domesticated psittacines (including parrots) or other birds that can carry the bacteria asymptomatically.\nGermany\nGermany reported an increase in individuals who tested positive for\nC. psittaci\nin December 2023 with five confirmed cases, making a total of 14 confirmed cases in 2023. In 2024, as of 20 February, another five confirmed cases of psittacosis were notified. There are no reports of a geographical cluster, except with an accumulation of cases around the city of Hannover over the last year. Almost all cases had pneumonia (18/19), 16 of whom were hospitalized.\nAmong the 19 cases notified from 1 January 2023 to 19 February 2024, none had information on exposure to wild birds, although 26% (5/19) of cases reported exposure to domesticated birds such as parrots, chickens, or breeding pigeons.\nOver the past five years, Germany has reported an average of 15 cases per year, with the highest number of cases in 2022 (19 cases) and the lowest number in 2019 (11 cases). Usually, around zero to two cases per month are reported. Around 72% (56/78) of the cases in the last five years were confirmed by antibody testing. Information on bird exposure is often missing.\nSweden\nSweden reported an unusually high number of cases of psittacosis in late November 2023 and early December 2023, with seven cases reported in November 2023 and 19 cases reported in December 2023. This represents a doubling of the number of cases compared to respective months in the previous five years.\nIn 2024, however, ten cases were reported in January and three cases in February, which is lower than the average number of cases reported in the same period in the previous five years. Overall, Sweden reported an increase in the number of reported cases of psittacosis from 2017 onwards.\nGeographically, cases reported as of early November 2023, are distributed between eight of the 21 regions of Sweden, all located in the southernmost third of the country. Reported cases have been in contact with droppings from small birds, mainly via feeders, and a few are thought to have been infected via domestic birds (hens or cockatoos).\nChanges in diagnostic practices have likely contributed to this increase, as it has become increasingly common to use RT-PCR panels for screening.\nThe Netherlands\nThe Netherlands observed an increase of confirmed psittacosis cases since late December 2023, with 21 individuals reported as positive for\nC. psittaci\nas of 29 February 2024, which is twice as many cases as the same period in previous years. Over the past ten years, there has been an average of nine cases reported during the same period.\nRecent cases have been geographically spread throughout the country with no common source of infection being identified. The cases had an average age of 67 (range: 37-86 years), of whom 16 were men (76%). All recent cases were hospitalized and one case died.\nSix of the 21 cases reported since late December 2023 have noted contact with droppings of wild birds, seven had contact with droppings of domestic birds, and eight cases did not report any contact with birds.\nTesting procedures have not changed in recent years in the Netherlands. Since 2018, more than 95% of the notifications are based on RT-PCR testing.\n\nChlamydophila\npsittaci\nis a bacterium that causes the zoonotic disease of psittacosis in humans. Human infections are generally associated with those who work with pet birds, poultry workers, veterinarians, pet bird owners, and gardeners in areas where\nC. psittaci\nis epizootic in the native bird population.\nC. psittaci\nis associated with more than 450 avian species and has also been found in various mammalian species, including dogs, cats, horses, large and small ruminants, swine, and reptiles. However, birds, especially pet birds (psittacine birds, finches, canaries, and pigeons), are most frequently involved in causing human psittacosis.\u00a0Disease transmission to humans occurs mainly through inhalation of airborne particles from respiratory secretions, dried faeces, or feather dust. Direct contact with birds is not required for infection to occur.\nIn general, psittacosis is a mild illness, with symptoms including fever and chills, headache, muscle aches and dry cough. Most people begin developing signs and symptoms within 5 to 14 days after exposure to the bacteria.\nPrompt antibiotic treatment is effective and allows avoiding complications such as pneumonia. With appropriate antibiotic treatment, psittacosis rarely (less than 1 in 100 cases) results in death.\n\nHuman psittacosis is a notifiable disease in the concerned countries. Epidemiological investigations were implemented to identify potential exposure and clusters of cases.\nNational surveillance systems are closely monitoring the situation, including laboratory analysis of samples from wild birds submitted for avian influenza testing to verify the prevalence of\nC. psittaci\namong wild birds.\n\nOverall, five countries in the WHO European region reported an unusual and unexpected increase in reports of cases of\nC. psittaci\n. \u00a0Some of the reported cases developed pneumonia and resulted in hospitalization, and fatal cases were also reported.\nSweden has reported a general increase in psittacosis cases since 2017, which could be associated with the increased use of more sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panels. The increase in reported psittacosis cases across all countries requires additional investigation to determine whether it is a true increase in cases or an increase due to more sensitive surveillance or diagnostic techniques.\nWhile birds that carry this disease could be crossing international borders, there is currently no indication of this disease being spread by humans nationally or internationally. Generally, people do not spread the bacteria that causes psittacosis to other people, so there is a low likelihood of further human-to-human transmission of the disease. If correctly diagnosed, this pathogen is treatable by antibiotics.\nWHO continues to monitor the situation, and based on the available information, assesses the risk posed by this event as low.\n\nWHO recommends the following measures for the prevention and control of psittacosis:\nincreasing the awareness of clinicians to test suspected cases of\nC. psittaci\nfor diagnosis using RT-PCR.\nincreasing awareness among caged or domestic bird owners, especially psittacines, that the pathogen can be carried without apparent illness.\nquarantining newly acquired birds. If any bird is sick, contact the veterinarian for an examination and treatment.\nconducting surveillance of\nC. psittaci\nin wild birds, potentially including existing specimens collected for other reasons.\nencouraging people with pet birds to keep cages clean, position cages so that droppings cannot spread among them and avoid over-crowded cages.\npromoting good hygiene, including frequent hand washing, when handling birds, their faeces, and their environments.\nstandard infection-control practices and droplet transmission precautions should be implemented for hospitalized patients.\n\nUnited States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

        "content": "Outbreaks of Nipah virus (NiV) infection are seasonal in Bangladesh, with cases usually occurring annually between December and April corresponding with the harvesting and consumption of date palm sap. Since 1 January and as of 9 February 2024, two laboratory-confirmed cases of NiV have been reported from the Dhaka division of Bangladesh. Both cases have died. \r\n\r\nWHO assesses the overall risk at the national levels to be moderate due to the severity of the disease, the limitation of treatment, the shared natural habitat of bats and zoonotic transmission partners, and the fact that there are no licensed vaccines to prevent NiV infection.\n\nOn 30 January and 7 February 2024, the Bangladesh National Focal Point (NFP) for the International Health Regulations (IHR) notified the World Health Organization (WHO)\u00a0of two epidemiologically unlinked cases of NiV\u00a0infection.\nFirst case confirmed on 21 January 2024\nThe first patient is a 38-year-old male from Manikganj district, Dhaka division. The patient developed a fever followed by respiratory distress, restlessness, and insomnia on 11 January 2024 and was admitted to a local hospital on 16 January. He was transferred to the intensive care unit of a hospital in Dhaka City on 18 January where he was intubated due to worsening of\u00a0symptoms.\nOn 21 January, blood and throat samples were collected and the patient tested positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for NiV RNA from the throat sample and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-NiV Immunoglobulin M (IgM) from serum. On 27 January, the case was transferred to another hospital in Dhaka city, where he died on 28 January.\nThe case had a history of consuming raw date palm sap on 31 December 2023. As of 30 January 2024, a total of 91 contacts had been identified, including 11 family members, 20 from the community, and 60 healthcare personnel from different hospitals. However, none of the contacts tested positive for NiV by PCR or anti-NiV IgM by ELISA.\nSecond case confirmed on 31 January 2024\nThe second patient is a three-year-old female from Shariatpur district, Dhaka division. The patient visited a healthcare facility on 30 January 2024 with a two-day history of fever, altered consciousnesses, and seizures. The case was diagnosed with encephalitis and shock and was transferred to the isolation ward of another hospital in Dhaka city on the same day. Blood and throat samples were collected on 30 January and on 31 January, the case was laboratory-confirmed with NiV infection by RT-PCR for NiV RNA from the throat sample and by ELISA for anti-NiV IgM from serum and died on the same day.\nThe case had a history of regularly consuming fresh raw date palm sap. As of 7 February 2024, 67 contacts were identified, including three family members, 21 from the community and 46 healthcare personnel from different hospitals. All identified contacts tested negative for NiV by PCR or anti-NiV IgM by ELISA.\nSince the report of the first case in 2001, human infections have been reported almost every year, with case fatality rate varying between 25% (in 2009) and 92% (in 2005) (Figure 1). Clusters of cases are mainly reported in the country\u2019s central and northwest districts.\nFigure 1.\nNumber of reported Nipah virus cases and deaths by year, 1 January 2001 \u2013 9 February 2024, Bangladesh.\n\nNiV infection is a bat-borne zoonotic disease transmitted to humans through infected animals (such as bats or pigs) or food contaminated with saliva, urine and excreta of infected animals. It can also be transmitted directly from person to person through close contact with an infected person (although less common).\u00a0Fruit bats or flying foxes (Pteropus species) are the natural hosts for Nipah virus.\nThe incubation period is believed to range from 4 to 14 days. However, an incubation period of up to 45 days has been reported. Laboratory diagnosis of a patient with a clinical history of NiV infection can be made during the acute and convalescent phases of the disease\u00a0by using a combination of tests. The main tests used are RT-PCR from bodily fluids and antibody detection via ELISA.\nNiV infection in humans causes a range of clinical presentations including acute respiratory infection and fatal encephalitis. Further information about NiV infection can be found\nhere\n.\nThe case-fatality rates in outbreaks across Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, and Singapore typically range from 40% to 100%, depending on local capabilities for early detection and clinical management. Although antivirals are in development, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available for the prevention or treatment of NiV infection.\n\nThe following public health response has been implemented by the government of Bangladesh and WHO:\nNationwide awareness and health education activities are ongoing through print and electronic media, including distribution of posters and leaflets in the endemic districts.\nRisk communication activities engaging government officials, physicians, preachers, and farmers are ongoing. As of 31 January, these have been completed in Rajshahi, Jashore, Madaripur and Rajbari districts.\nWHO is working with the counterparts to strengthen surveillance, infection, prevention and control (IPC), risk communication, prompt diagnosis and management of infected patients.\nOne Health Partners (Department of Livestock, Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute, Department of Forest, icddr,b) have been sensitized and engaged. Printed leaflets with health education messages have been produced.\n\nWHO assesses the overall risk at the national level to be moderate due to following reasons:\nThe case fatality rate from NiV infection is high. Initial signs and symptoms      of Nipah virus infection are non-specific, and the diagnosis is often not      suspected at the time of presentation.\u00a0This can hinder accurate      diagnosis and creates challenges in outbreak detection, effective and      timely infection control measures, and outbreak response activities.\nThere are currently no specific drugs or vaccines available for NiV infection      although WHO has identified Nipah as a priority disease for the WHO      Research and Development Blueprint.\u00a0 Intensive supportive care is      recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications.\nThere is continued consumption of raw date palm sap by the community despite ongoing efforts for risk communication and community engagement to address food safety and risks to health.\nDespite these risk criteria, strong public health measures are in place to detect and control outbreaks including through the use of hospital-based systematic human NiV infection surveillance system which has been in place since 2006, and the utilization of the National Rapid Response Team (NRRT) at the central level and the Rapid Response Team (RRT) at the district level.\nWHO assesses the risk at the regional level to be moderate. Although Bangladesh borders India and Myanmar, currently affected districts do not share an international land border. While there have not been any instances of cross-border transmission previously, this risk remains given the shared ecological corridor for the virus natural host (\nPteropus\nbats) and occurrence among domestic animals and humans previously in both Bangladesh and India. India, however, has experience of controlling previous outbreaks of NiV infection.\nWHO assesses the risk at the global level to be low, as there have been no previous confirmed cases outside Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, and Singapore.\n\nIn the absence of a vaccine or licensed treatment available for Nipah virus disease, the key to reducing or preventing infection is by strengthening early detection surveillance and contact tracing, raising awareness of the risk factors and supporting people with measures they can take to reduce exposure to the NiV. Case management should focus on the delivery of timely supportive care and be supported by a good laboratory system. Intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications.\nPublic health educational messages should focus on:\nReducing the risk of bat-to-human transmission\nEfforts to prevent transmission should first focus on decreasing bat access to date palm sap and other fresh food products. Freshly collected date palm juice should be boiled, and fruits should be thoroughly washed and peeled before consumption. Fruits with signs of bat bites should be discarded. Areas where bats are known to roost should be avoided.\nReducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission\nNatural infection in animals has been described in farming pigs, horses, and domestic and feral cats. Gloves and other protective clothing should be worn while handling sick animals or their tissues, and during slaughtering and culling procedures. As much as possible, people should avoid being in contact with infected pigs. In endemic areas, when establishing new pig farms, considerations should be given to presence of fruit bats in the area and in general, pig feed and pig sheds should be protected against bats when feasible.\nReducing the risk of human-to-human transmission\nClose unprotected physical contact with NiV-infected people should be avoided. Regular hand washing should be carried out after caring for or visiting sick people.\nControlling infection in health care settings\nHealth care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed infection, or handling their specimens, should implement standard infection control precautions at all times.\u00a0\u00a0 As human-to-human transmission has been reported, particularly in health-care settings, contact and droplet precautions should be used along with standard precautions. Airborne precautions may be required in certain circumstances.\u202f\u202fSamples taken from people and animals with suspected NiV infection should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.\nWHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions toward Bangladesh based on the currently available information.\n\nWHO South-East Asia Regional      Strategy for the prevention and control of Nipah virus infection 2023-2030\nNipah virus factsheet\nSituation Dashboard,      Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR)\nNipah Virus Transmission in      Bangladesh\nFoodborne Transmission of Nipah      Virus, Bangladesh\nNipah Virus Disease: Epidemiological,      Clinical, Diagnostic and Legislative Aspects of This Unpredictable      Emerging Zoonosis\nThe Ecology of Nipah      Virus in Bangladesh: A Nexus of Land-Use Change and Opportunistic Feeding      Behavior in Bats\nCitable reference:\nWorld Health Organization (27 February 2024).
