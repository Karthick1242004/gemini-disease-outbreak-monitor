# Disease Monitoring System

## Overview

The Disease Monitoring System is a comprehensive project designed to scrape disease outbreak information from the World Health Organization (WHO) website, store this data in a JSON file, and then use the Gemini AI API to extract and provide key details such as the disease name and the number of victims. The project utilizes Python for web scraping, Node.js for the backend server, and React (with Vite) for the frontend interface.
